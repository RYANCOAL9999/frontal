# **Frontal**

**QVOES Project Backend Test Task**  
This Readme provides instructions for setting up and running the full system for the Frontal API Services.

### **How to Run the Full System:**

To set up and run the system, follow these steps:

1. **Start the PostgreSQL Services:**  
   Navigate to the databases directory and launch the PostgreSQL services using Docker Compose. This will start the necessary database containers in the background.  
   cd databases  
   chmod a+x startDatabases.sh  
   sh startDatabases.sh

   Note: Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed and running on your system.  
2. Grant Execution Permissions to Shell Scripts:  
   Navigate to the server directory and provide executable permissions to the following scripts: active.sh, deactivate.sh, and install.sh.  
   cd ../server  
   chmod a+x active.sh deactivate.sh install.sh

   Note: These scripts are essential for activating and installing necessary components of the backend service.  
3. Run the active.sh and install.sh Scripts:  
   First, execute active.sh to activate the necessary services or configurations. Then, run install.sh to install any required dependencies and set up the environment.  
   sh active.sh  
   sh install.sh

   Note: These scripts must be run in sequence for proper initialization and setup of the backend.  
4. Consider Cython for Performance (Optional but Recommended):  
   The project includes a computationally intensive image processing component. By default, it will fall back to a pure Python implementation if the Cython-compiled version is not found. For optimal performance, especially in load testing or production scenarios, it is highly recommended to compile the Cython module.  
   * **Prerequisites:**  
     * Ensure Cython is installed (pip install Cython).  
     * You need a C compiler installed on your system (e.g., gcc on Linux/macOS, or Visual Studio Build Tools on Windows).  
   * To Compile the Cython Module:  
     Navigate to the exlib/pyc directory and run the compilation script:  
     cd exlib/pyc  
     chmod a+x compile\_image\_processor.sh  
     sh compile\_image\_processor.sh

     This will create a compiled .so (Linux/macOS) or .pyd (Windows) file alongside image\_processor.pyx. The application will automatically detect and use this compiled version if available.  
5. Grant Execution Permissions and Start the API Service:  
   Navigate to the api directory and provide executable permissions to the startAPIService.sh script. This script will start the API service for the project.  
   cd api  
   chmod a+x startAPIService.sh  
   sh startAPIService.sh

   Note: Ensure the system's environment variables and configurations are properly set before starting the API service.

Additional Notes:  
Ensure that all necessary environment variables (such as database credentials) are set up correctly before running the scripts.  
If you make any modifications to the database or backend, be sure to restart the relevant services to apply changes.  
HowToStopDockerCompose:  
bash docker compose stop yourservices  
Note: Ensure the system's environment variables and configurations are properly set before starting the API service.  
Troubleshooting:  
If you encounter any issues during these steps, please check the logs for errors.  
Ensure that all dependencies are installed and that the PostgreSQL container is running.  
You may need to restart services if the system does not behave as expected.  
**Dependencies:**

* Docker & Docker Compose: For managing containers and services.  
* PostgreSQL: The relational database management system used by the project.  
* Shell Scripts: The project requires several shell scripts for activation, installation, and service management.  
* Cython: (Optional, but recommended for performance) For compiling Python code to C.

Tip: If you experience any slow performance, consider checking your systemâ€™s resource usage, as Docker containers may consume significant CPU/RAM resources.
